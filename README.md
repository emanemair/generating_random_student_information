- **`students.csv`**: Output CSV file containing student information.
- **`README.md`**: This file you're currently reading.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
- **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
- **`names`**: A Python package used to generate random names.

## Usage

### Setup

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Generate Data

Run the `main.py` script to generate synthetic student data, assign courses randomly, and create the `students.csv` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Understanding the Code

- **`main.py`**: Contains the main code generating student data, assigning courses, and creating the CSV.

### CSV File

The generated `students.csv` file contains student information:
- Names
- IDs
- Payment status
- Number of courses
- Respective course details

### Further Improvements

- Enhance course assignment logic to prevent duplication.
- Add functionality for specific course prerequisites or constraints.
